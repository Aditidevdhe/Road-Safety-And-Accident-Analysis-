# Road-Safety-And-Accident-Analysis-
# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

An interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes key insights from road accident data to help identify trends, high-risk zones, and factors contributing to accidents. This project leverages **pivot tables**, **pivot charts**, and **slicers** to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface for data exploration.

  - Area (Urban/Rural)
  - Road Type
  - Vehicle Type
  - Weather Conditions
  - Light Conditions
- **Pivot Charts** and Visualizations:
  - **Column and Bar Charts** to show accident counts by vehicle type, weather, and lighting
  - **Line Charts** to visualize accident trends over months
  - **Pie Charts** to display severity distribution
  - **Map Chart** (if applicable) to show geographic hotspots
- **Slicers** for real-time filtering by:
  - Year
  - Area
  - Severity
  - Road Type
  - Weather
  - Light Conditions

## 📌 Key KPIs and Metrics

| KPI                       | Description                                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Accidents**       | Total number of reported accidents                 |
| **Fatal Accidents**       | Count of fatal accidents                           |
| **Injuries**              | Number of serious and slight injuries              |
| **Accidents by Time**     | Peak hours and days for accident occurrences       |
| **Accidents by Road Type**| Insights on highways vs. urban/rural roads         |
| **Vehicle-wise Analysis** | Breakdown of accidents by vehicle involvement      |
| **Weather Impact**        | Correlation of accidents with weather conditions   |

## 🧠 Insights Derived

- Peak accident hours are in the evening and early morning.
- Rain and fog significantly increase accident probability.
- Rural areas tend to have a higher share of fatal accidents.
- Two-wheelers and cars account for the majority of incidents.
- Poor lighting conditions (e.g., nighttime without streetlights) contribute to higher severity.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

- **Data Cleaning** and preparation within Excel (removing blanks, categorizing fields)
- Multiple **Pivot Tables** created for each analytical dimension (e.g., accidents by vehicle, by time, by weather)
- **Pivot Charts** connected to pivot tables for interactive visuals
- **Slicers** added for filtering across visuals simultaneously
- **Dashboard** sheet created to centralize all visuals and KPIs in a clean layout
